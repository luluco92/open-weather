# Open Weather Map
## Deployment Link
https://luluco92.github.io/open-weather/

## Description
Simple weather dashboard where you can look up a city and get the weather of the current day, and a 5 day forecast there. Powered by the openweathermap API.
The dashboard also saves previous searches in local storage that can be quickly accessed again for convenience.

## Limitation
41 3-hr blocs are required to show a 5 day forecast, but only 40 blocs are allowed by the free version of the API. This means that the time difference between the current weather and tomorrows forecast is not equal to the time difference between the other forecasts.
